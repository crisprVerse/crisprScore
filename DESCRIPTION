Description:
    Provides R wrappers of several on-target and off-target scoring methods for CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs).
    The following nucleases are supported: SpCas9, AsCas12a, enAsCas12a, and RfxCas13d (CasRx).
    The available on-target cutting efficiency scoring methods are RuleSet1, Azimuth, DeepHF, DeepCpf1, 
    enPAM+GB, and CRISPRscan. Both the CFD and MIT scoring methods are available for off-target
    specificity prediction. The package also provides a Lindel-derived score to predict the probability
    of a gRNA to produce indels inducing a frameshift for the Cas9 nuclease.
    Note that DeepHF, DeepCpf1 and enPAM+GB are not available on Windows machines.
